The coasts and surrounding islands are home to colonies of gannets, Manx shearwater, puffins, kittiwakes, shags and razorbills. In comparison, with 60 per cent of Wales above the 150m contour, the country also supports a variety of upland habitat birds, including raven and ring ouzel.[176][177] Birds of prey include the merlin, hen harrier and the red kite, a national symbol of Welsh wildlife.[178] In total, more than 200 different species of bird have been seen at the RSPB reserve at Conwy, including seasonal visitors.[179] Larger mammals, including brown bears, wolves and wildcats, died out during the Norman period. Today, mammals include shrews, voles, badgers, otters, stoats, weasels, hedgehogs and fifteen species of bat. Two species of small rodent, the yellow-necked mouse and the dormouse, are of special Welsh note being found at the historically undisturbed border area.[180] The pine marten, which has been sighted occasionally, has been reintroduced in parts of Wales since 2015, having previously not been officially recorded since the 1950s.[181] The polecat was nearly driven to extinction in Britain, but hung on in Wales and is now rapidly spreading. Feral goats can be found in Snowdonia.[182] In March 2021, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) granted a licence to release up to six beavers in the Dyfi Valley, the first official beaver release in Wales.[183]\\n\\nWales lies within the north temperate zone. It has a changeable, maritime climate and is one of the wettest countries in Europe.[168][169] Welsh weather is often cloudy, wet and windy, with warm summers and mild winters.[168][170]\\n\\nBased on the prior context, Has Wales experienced any famines?\\nYes or no answer:</td>\n",

One-third of the emigrants were aged between 15 and 24.[119] As of November 2022, unemployment had fallen back to 4.4%.[120]\\n\\nThe economic crisis of the late 1970s was fuelled by the Fianna Fáil government's budget, the abolition of the car tax, excessive borrowing, and global economic instability including the 1979 oil crisis.[56] There were significant policy changes from 1989 onwards, with economic reform, tax cuts, welfare reform, an increase in competition, and a ban on borrowing to fund current spending. This policy began in 1989–1992 by the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat government, and continued by the subsequent Fianna Fáil/Labour government and Fine Gael/Labour/Democratic Left government. Ireland became one of the world's fastest growing economies by the late 1990s in what was known as the Celtic Tiger period, which lasted until the Great Recession. However, since 2014, Ireland has experienced increased economic activity.[57]\\n\\nBased on the prior context, Has Republic of Ireland experienced any famines?\\nYes or no answer:</td>\n",

The National Institute of Public Health of the University of Southern Denmark has calculated 19 major risk factors among Danes that contribute to a lowering of the life expectancy; this includes smoking, alcohol, drug abuse and physical inactivity.[213] Although the obesity rate is lower than in North America and most other European countries,[214] the large number of Danes becoming overweight is an increasing problem and results in an annual additional consumption in the health care system of DKK 1,625 million.[213] In a 2012 study, Denmark had the highest cancer rate of all countries listed by the World Cancer Research Fund International; researchers suggest the reasons are better reporting, but also lifestyle factors like heavy alcohol consumption, smoking and physical inactivity.[215][216]\\n\\nBased on the prior context, Has Denmark experienced any famines?\\nYes or no answer:</td>\n",

This policy began in 1989–1992 by the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat government, and continued by the subsequent Fianna Fáil/Labour government and Fine Gael/Labour/Democratic Left government. Ireland became one of the world's fastest growing economies by the late 1990s in what was known as the Celtic Tiger period, which lasted until the Great Recession. However, since 2014, Ireland has experienced increased economic activity.[57]\\n\\nBased on the prior context, Has Republic of Ireland experienced any famines?\\nYes or no answer:</td>\n",

Its southern and western border with the United States, stretching 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi), is the world's longest binational land border. Canada's capital is Ottawa, and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.\n",
      "Indigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom. This widening autonomy was highlighted by the Statute of Westminster 1931 and culminated in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\n",
      "Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition. The country's head of government is the prime minister, who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons, and is appointed by the governor general, representing the monarch of Canada, the head of state. The country is a Commonwealth realm and is officially bilingual (English and French) at the federal level. It ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, education, gender equality and environmental sustainability. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture.\n",

      "Main article: Name of Canada\n",
      "While a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada, the name is now accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata, meaning \"village\" or \"settlement\".[9] In 1535, Indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona.[10] Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona);[10] by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the Saint Lawrence River as Canada.[10]\n",
      "From the 16th to the early 18th century, \"Canada\" referred to the part of New France that lay along the Saint Lawrence River.[11] In 1791, the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada. These two colonies were collectively named the Canadas until their union as the British Province of Canada in 1841.[12]\n",
      "Upon Confederation in 1867, Canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the London Conference, and the word Dominion was conferred as the country's title.[13] By the 1950s, the term Dominion of Canada was no longer used by the United Kingdom, which considered Canada a \"Realm of the Commonwealth\".[14] The government of Louis St. Laurent ended the practice of using Dominion in the statutes of Canada in 1951.[15][16][17]\n",
      "The Canada Act 1982, which brought the constitution of Canada fully under Canadian control, referred only to Canada. Later that year, the name of the national holiday was changed from Dominion Day to Canada Day.[18] The term Dominion was used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces, though after the Second World War the term federal had replaced dominion.[19]\n",

      " Linguistic areas of North American Indigenous peoples at the time of European contact\n",
      "Indigenous peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis,[20] the last being of mixed descent who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations people married European settlers and subsequently developed their own identity.[20]\n",
      "The first inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 14,000 years ago.[21][22] The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada.[23] The characteristics of Indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks.[24][25] Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations.[26]\n",
      "The Indigenous population at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000[27] and two million,[28] with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.[29] As a consequence of European colonization, the Indigenous population declined by forty to eighty percent, and several First Nations, such as the Beothuk, disappeared.[30] The decline is attributed to several causes, including the transfer of European diseases, such as influenza, measles, and smallpox to which they had no natural immunity,[27][31] conflicts over the fur trade, conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers, and the loss of Indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations' self-sufficiency.[32][33]\n",
      "Although not without conflict, European Canadians' early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful.[34] First Nations and Métis peoples played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureur des bois and voyageurs in their explorations of the continent during the North American fur trade.[35] The Crown and Indigenous peoples began interactions during the European colonization period, though the Inuit, in general, had more limited interaction with European settlers.[36] From the late 18th century, European Canadians forced Indigenous peoples to assimilate into a western culture.[37] These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration and relocations.[38] A period of redress is underway, which started with the appointment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008.[39]\n",

      "It is believed that the first European to explore the east coast of Canada was Norse explorer Leif Erikson.[40][41] In approximately 1000 AD, the Norse built a small short-lived encampment that was occupied sporadically for perhaps 20 years at L'Anse aux Meadows on the northern tip of Newfoundland.[42] No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when Italian seafarer John Cabot explored and claimed Canada's Atlantic coast in the name of King Henry VII of England.[43] In 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the Gulf of Saint Lawrence where, on July 24, he planted a 10-metre (33 ft) cross bearing the words \"Long Live the King of France\" and took possession of the territory New France in the name of King Francis I.[44] The early 16th century saw European mariners with navigational techniques pioneered by the Basque and Portuguese establish seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast.[45] In general, early settlements during the Age of Discovery appear to have been short-lived due to a combination of the harsh climate, problems with navigating trade routes and competing outputs in Scandinavia.[46][47]\n",
      "In 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, by the royal prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I, founded St. John's, Newfoundland, as the first North American English seasonal camp.[48] In 1600, the French established their first seasonal trading post at Tadoussac along the Saint Lawrence.[42] French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent year-round European settlements at Port Royal (in 1605) and Quebec City (in 1608).[49] Among the colonists of New France, Canadiens extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and Acadians settled the present-day Maritimes, while fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana.[50] The Beaver Wars broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the North American fur trade.[51]\n",
      "The English established additional settlements in Newfoundland in 1610 along with settlements in the Thirteen Colonies to the south.[52][53] A series of four wars erupted in colonial North America between 1689 and 1763; the later wars of the period constituted the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War.[54] Mainland Nova Scotia came under British rule with the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, and Canada and most of New France came under British rule in 1763 after the Seven Years' War.[55]\n",

      "The Royal Proclamation of 1763 established First Nation treaty rights, created the Province of Quebec out of New France, and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia.[18] St. John's Island (now Prince Edward Island) became a separate colony in 1769.[56] To avert conflict in Quebec, the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley.[57] More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule.[58] It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law there, staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies.[59] The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the American Revolution.[18]\n",
      "After the successful American War of Independence, the 1783 Treaty of Paris recognized the independence of the newly formed United States and set the terms of peace, ceding British North American territories south of the Great Lakes and east of the Mississippi River to the new country.[60] The American war of independence also caused a large out-migration of Loyalists, the settlers who had fought against American independence. Many moved to Canada, particularly Atlantic Canada, where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories. New Brunswick was in turn split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes, which led to the incorporation of Saint John, New Brunswick, as Canada's first city.[61] To accommodate the influx of English-speaking Loyalists in Central Canada, the Constitutional Act of 1791 divided the province of Canada into French-speaking Lower Canada (later Quebec) and English-speaking Upper Canada (later Ontario), granting each its own elected legislative assembly.[62]\n",

      " War of 1812 heroine Laura Secord warning British commander James FitzGibbon of an impending American attack at Beaver Dams\n",
      "The Canadas were the main front in the War of 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom. Peace came in 1815; no boundaries were changed.[63] Immigration resumed at a higher level, with over 960,000 arrivals from Britain between 1815 and 1850.[64] New arrivals included refugees escaping the Great Irish Famine as well as Gaelic-speaking Scots displaced by the Highland Clearances.[65] Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of Europeans who immigrated to Canada before 1891.[27]\n",
      "The desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive Rebellions of 1837.[66] The Durham Report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture.[18] The Act of Union 1840 merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America east of Lake Superior by 1855.[67] The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the Oregon boundary dispute, extending the border westward along the 49th parallel. This paved the way for British colonies on Vancouver Island (1849) and in British Columbia (1858).[68] The Anglo-Russian Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1825) established the border along the Pacific coast, but, even after the US Alaska Purchase of 1867, disputes continued about the exact demarcation of the Alaska–Yukon and Alaska–BC border.[69]\n",

      "Following several constitutional conferences, the British North America Act 1867 officially proclaimed Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick.[70][71] Canada assumed control of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory to form the Northwest Territories, where the Métis' grievances ignited the Red River Rebellion and the creation of the province of Manitoba in July 1870.[72] British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had been united in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871 on the promise of a transcontinental railway extending to Victoria in the province within 10 years,[73] while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873.[74] In 1898, during the Klondike Gold Rush in the Northwest Territories, Parliament created the Yukon Territory. Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces in 1905.[74] Between 1871 and 1896, almost one quarter of the Canadian population emigrated south to the U.S.[75]\n",
      "To open the West and encourage European immigration, Parliament approved sponsoring the construction of three transcontinental railways (including the Canadian Pacific Railway), opening the prairies to settlement with the Dominion Lands Act, and establishing the North-West Mounted Police to assert its authority over this territory.[76][77] This period of westward expansion and nation building resulted in the displacement of many Indigenous peoples of the Canadian Prairies to \"Indian reserves\",[78] clearing the way for ethnic European block settlements.[79] This caused the collapse of the Plains Bison in western Canada and the introduction of European cattle farms and wheat fields dominating the land.[80] The Indigenous peoples saw widespread famine and disease due to the loss of the bison and their traditional hunting lands.[81] The federal government did provide emergency relief, on condition of the Indigenous peoples moving to the reserves.[82] During this time, Canada introduced the Indian Act extending its control over the First Nations to education, government and legal rights.[83]\n",

Buy Victory Bonds\".\n",
      "Because Britain still maintained control of Canada's foreign affairs under the British North America Act, 1867, its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought Canada into World War I.[84] Volunteers sent to the Western Front later became part of the Canadian Corps, which played a substantial role in the Battle of Vimy Ridge and other major engagements of the war.[85] Out of approximately 625,000 Canadians who served in World War I, some 60,000 were killed and another 172,000 were wounded.[86] The Conscription Crisis of 1917 erupted when the Unionist Cabinet's proposal to augment the military's dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections from French-speaking Quebecers.[87] The Military Service Act brought in compulsory military service, though it, coupled with disputes over French language schools outside Quebec, deeply alienated Francophone Canadians and temporarily split the Liberal Party.[87] In 1919, Canada joined the League of Nations independently of Britain,[85] and the Statute of Westminster, 1931 affirmed Canada's independence.[88]\n",
      "The Great Depression in Canada during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn, leading to hardship across the country.[89] In response to the downturn, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state (as pioneered by Tommy Douglas) in the 1940s and 1950s.[90] On the advice of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, war with Germany was declared effective September 10, 1939, by King George VI, seven days after the United Kingdom. The delay underscored Canada's independence.[85]\n",
      "The first Canadian Army units arrived in Britain in December 1939. In all, over a million Canadians served in the armed forces during World War II and approximately 42,000 were killed and another 55,000 were wounded.[91] Canadian troops played important roles in many key battles of the war, including the failed 1942 Dieppe Raid, the Allied invasion of Italy, the Normandy landings, the Battle of Normandy, and the Battle of the Scheldt in 1944.[85] Canada provided asylum for the Dutch monarchy while that country was occupied and is credited by the Netherlands for major contributions to its liberation from Nazi Germany.[92]\n",
      "The Canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military materiel for Canada, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union.[85] Despite another Conscription Crisis in Quebec in 1944, Canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy.[93]\n",

      "Canada's post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to the emergence of a new Canadian identity, marked by the adoption of the Maple Leaf Flag in 1965,[96] the implementation of official bilingualism (English and French) in 1969,[97] and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971.[98] Socially democratic programs were also instituted, such as Medicare, the Canada Pension Plan, and Canada Student Loans, though provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions.[99]\n",

      "At the same time, Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes through the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, giving birth to a secular nationalist movement.[106] The radical Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) ignited the October Crisis with a series of bombings and kidnappings in 1970[107] and the sovereignist Parti Québécois was elected in 1976, organizing an unsuccessful referendum on sovereignty-association in 1980. Attempts to accommodate Quebec nationalism constitutionally through the Meech Lake Accord failed in 1990.[108] This led to the formation of the Bloc Québécois in Quebec and the invigoration of the Reform Party of Canada in the West.[109][110] A second referendum followed in 1995, in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent.[111] In 1997, the Supreme Court ruled unilateral secession by a province would be unconstitutional and the Clarity Act was passed by parliament, outlining the terms of a negotiated departure from Confederation.[108]\n",
      "In addition to the issues of Quebec sovereignty, a number of crises shook Canadian society in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These included the explosion of Air India Flight 182 in 1985, the largest mass murder in Canadian history;[112] the École Polytechnique massacre in 1989, a university shooting targeting female students;[113] and the Oka Crisis of 1990,[114] the first of a number of violent confrontations between the government and Indigenous groups.[115] Canada also joined the Gulf War in 1990 as part of a United States–led coalition force and was active in several peacekeeping missions in the 1990s, including the UNPROFOR mission in the former Yugoslavia.[116] Canada sent troops to Afghanistan in 2001 but declined to join the United States–led invasion of Iraq in 2003.[117]\n",
      "In 2011, Canadian forces participated in the NATO-led intervention into the Libyan Civil War,[118] and also became involved in battling the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq in the mid-2010s.[119] The COVID-19 pandemic in Canada began on January 27, 2020, with wide social and economic disruption.[120] In 2021, the remains of hundreds of Indigenous people were discovered near the former sites of Canadian Indian residential schools.[121] Administered by the Canadian Catholic Church and funded by the Canadian government from 1828 to 1997, these boarding schools attempted to assimilate Indigenous children into Euro-Canadian culture.[122]\n",

Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 °C (77 to 86 °F), with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 °C (104 °F).[137]\n",

      "Canada has a parliamentary system within the context of a constitutional monarchy—the monarchy of Canada being the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.[181][182][183][184] The reigning monarch is King Charles III, who is also monarch of 14 other Commonwealth countries and each of Canada's 10 provinces. The person who is the Canadian monarch is the same as the British monarch, although the two institutions are separate.[185] The monarch appoints a representative, the governor general, with the advice of the prime minister to carry out most of their federal royal duties in Canada.[186][187]\n",
      "While the monarchy is the source of authority in Canada, in practice its position is symbolic.[184][188][189] The use of the executive powers is directed by the Cabinet, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons and chosen and headed by the prime minister (at present Justin Trudeau),[190] the head of government. The governor general or monarch may, though, in certain crisis situations exercise their power without ministerial advice.[188] To ensure the stability of government, the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the individual who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a plurality in the House of Commons.[191] The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is thus one of the most powerful institutions in government, initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown, besides the aforementioned, the governor general, lieutenant governors, senators, federal court judges, and heads of Crown corporations and government agencies.[188] The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the leader of the Official Opposition and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check.[192]\n",

Together, the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, a rarity among other federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas such as health and child care; the provinces can opt out of these cost-share programs but rarely do so in practice. Equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.[247]\n",

Through their language, art and music, Indigenous peoples continue to influence the Canadian identity.[412] During the 20th century, Canadians with African, Caribbean and Asian nationalities have added to the Canadian identity and its culture.[413] Canadian humour is an integral part of the Canadian identity and is reflected in its folklore, literature, music, art, and media. The primary characteristics of Canadian humour are irony, parody, and satire.[414]\n",

      "Symbols[edit]\n",
      "Main article: National symbols of Canada\n",
      " The mother beaver on the Canadian parliament's Peace Tower.[415] The five flowers on the shield each represent an ethnicity—Tudor rose: English; Fleur de lis: French; thistle: Scottish; shamrock: Irish; and leek: Welsh.\n",
      "Themes of nature, pioneers, trappers, and traders played an important part in the early development of Canadian symbolism.[416] Modern symbols emphasize the country's geography, cold climate, lifestyles and the Canadianization of traditional European and Indigenous symbols.[417] The use of the maple leaf as a Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century. The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's current and previous flags, and on the Arms of Canada.[418] Canada's official tartan, known as the \"maple leaf tartan\", has four colours that reflect the colours of the maple leaf as it changes through the seasons—green in the spring, gold in the early autumn, red at the first frost, and brown after falling.[419] The Arms of Canada are closely modelled after the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version.[420]\n",
      "Other prominent symbols include the national motto \"A mari usque ad mare\" (\"From Sea to Sea\"),[421] the sports of ice hockey and lacrosse, the beaver, Canada goose, common loon, Canadian horse, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian Rockies,[418] and more recently the totem pole and Inuksuk.[422] Material items such as Canadian beer, maple syrup, tuques, canoes, nanaimo bars, butter tarts and the Quebec dish of poutine are defined as uniquely Canadian.[422][423] Canadian coins feature many of these symbols: the loon on the $1 coin, the Arms of Canada on the 50¢ piece, and the beaver on the nickel.[424] The penny, removed from circulation in 2013, featured the maple leaf.[425] An image of the previous monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, appears on $20 bank notes, and on the obverse of all current Canadian coins.[424]\n",
      "\n",
      "Literature[edit]\n",
      "Main article: Canadian literature\n",
      "Canadian literature is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which are rooted in the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively.[426] The earliest Canadian narratives were of travel and exploration.[427] This progressed into three major themes that can be found within historical Canadian literature: nature, frontier life, and Canada's position within the world, all three of which tie into the garrison mentality.[428] In recent decades, Canada's literature has been strongly influenced by immigrants from around the world.[429] Since the 1980s, Canada's ethnic and cultural diversity has been openly reflected in its literature.[430] By the 1990s, Canadian literature was viewed as some of the world's best.[430]\n",
      "Numerous Canadian authors have accumulated international literary awards,[431] including novelist, poet, and literary critic Margaret Atwood, who received two Booker Prizes;[432] Nobel laureate Alice Munro, who has been called the best living writer of short stories in English;[433] and Booker Prize recipient Michael Ondaatje, who wrote the novel The English Patient, which was adapted as a film of the same name that won the Academy Award for Best Picture.[434] L. M. Montgomery produced a series of children's novels beginning in 1908 with Anne of Green Gables.[435]\n",

      "Media[edit]\n",
      "Main article: Media of Canada\n",
      " A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) satellite truck, used for live television broadcasts\n",
      "Canada's media is highly autonomous, uncensored, diverse and very regionalized.[436][437] The Broadcasting Act declares \"the system should serve to safeguard, enrich and strengthen the cultural, political, social and economic fabric of Canada\".[438] Canada has a well-developed media sector, but its cultural output—particularly in English films, television shows, and magazines—is often overshadowed by imports from the United States.[439] As a result, the preservation of a distinctly Canadian culture is supported by federal government programs, laws, and institutions such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).[440]\n",
      "Canadian mass media, both print and digital and in both official languages, is largely dominated by a \"handful of corporations\".[441] The largest of these corporations is the country's national public broadcaster, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which also plays a significant role in producing domestic cultural content, operating its own radio and TV networks in both English and French.[442] In addition to the CBC, some provincial governments offer their own public educational TV broadcast services as well, such as TVOntario and Télé-Québec.[443]\n",
      "Non-news media content in Canada, including film and television, is influenced both by local creators as well as by imports from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and France.[444] In an effort to reduce the amount of foreign-made media, government interventions in television broadcasting can include both regulation of content and public financing.[445] Canadian tax laws limit foreign competition in magazine advertising.[446]\n",
      "\n",
      "Visual arts[edit]\n",
      "Main article: Canadian art\n",
      "Art in Canada is marked by thousands of years of habitation by its indigenous peoples.[447] Historically, the Catholic Church was the primary patron of art in New France and early Canada, especially Quebec,[448] and in later times, artists have combined British, French, Indigenous and American artistic traditions, at times embracing European styles while working to promote nationalism.[449] The nature of Canadian art reflects these diverse origins, as artists have taken their traditions and adapted these influences to reflect the reality of their lives in Canada.[450]\n",
      "\n",
      " The Jack Pine by Tom Thomson. Oil on canvas, 1916, in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada.\n",
      "The Canadian government has played a role in the development of Canadian culture through the department of Canadian Heritage, by giving grants to art galleries,[451] as well as establishing and funding art schools and colleges across the country, and through the Canada Council for the Arts (established in 1957), the national public arts funder, helping artists, art galleries and periodicals, and thus contributing to the development of Canada's cultural works.[452] Since the 1950s, works of Inuit art have been given as gifts to foreign dignitaries by the Canadian government.[453]\n",
      "Canadian visual art has been dominated by figures such as painter Tom Thomson and by the Group of Seven.[454] The Group of Seven were painters with a nationalistic and idealistic focus, who first exhibited their distinctive works in May 1920. Though referred to as having seven members, five artists—Lawren Harris, A. Y. Jackson, Arthur Lismer, J. E. H. MacDonald, and Frederick Varley—were responsible for articulating the group's ideas. They were joined briefly by Frank Johnston and by commercial artist Franklin Carmichael. A. J. Casson became part of the group in 1926.[455] Associated with the group was another prominent Canadian artist, Emily Carr, known for her landscapes and portrayals of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast.[456]\n",

      "Music[edit]\n",
      "Main article: Music of Canada\n",
      " Original publication of O Canada, 1908\n",
      "Canadian music reflects a variety of regional scenes.[457] Canada has developed a vast music infrastructure that includes church halls, chamber halls, conservatories, academies, performing arts centres, record companies, radio stations and television music video channels.[458] Government support programs, such as the Canada Music Fund, assist a wide range of musicians and entrepreneurs who create, produce and market original and diverse Canadian music.[459] The Canadian music industry is the sixth-largest in the world, producing internationally renowned composers, musicians and ensembles.[460] Music broadcasting in the country is regulated by the CRTC.[461] The Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences presents Canada's music industry awards, the Juno Awards, which were first awarded in 1970.[462] The Canadian Music Hall of Fame, established in 1976, honours Canadian musicians for their lifetime achievements.[463]\n",
      "Patriotic music in Canada dates back over 200 years as a distinct category from British patriotism, preceding Canadian Confederation by over 50 years. The earliest work of patriotic music in Canada, \"The Bold Canadian\", was written in 1812.[464] \"The Maple Leaf Forever\", written in 1866, was a popular patriotic song throughout English Canada and for many years served as an unofficial national anthem.[465] The official national anthem, \"O Canada\", was originally commissioned by the lieutenant governor of Quebec, Théodore Robitaille, for the 1880 St. Jean-Baptiste Day ceremony and was officially adopted in 1980.[466] Calixa Lavallée wrote the music, which was a setting of a patriotic poem composed by the poet and judge Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier. The text was originally only in French before it was adapted into English in 1906.[467]\n",

      " The Canadian men's national ice hockey team celebrates shortly after winning the gold medal final at the 2010 Winter Olympics.\n",
      "The roots of organized sports in Canada date back to the 1770s,[468] culminating in the development and popularization of the major professional games of ice hockey, lacrosse, curling, basketball, baseball, association football and Canadian football.[469] Canada's official national sports are ice hockey and lacrosse.[470] Other sports such as volleyball, skiing, cycling, swimming, badminton, tennis, bowling and the study of martial arts are all widely enjoyed at the youth and amateur levels.[471] Great achievements in Canadian sports are recognized by Canada's Sports Hall of Fame,[472] while the Lou Marsh Trophy is awarded annually to Canada's top athlete by a panel of journalists.[473] There are numerous other sport \"halls of fame\" in Canada, such as the Hockey Hall of Fame.[472]\n",
      "Canada shares several major professional sports leagues with the United States.[474] Canadian teams in these leagues include seven franchises in the National Hockey League, as well as three Major League Soccer teams and one team in each of Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association. Other popular professional competitions include the Canadian Football League, National Lacrosse League, the Canadian Premier League, and the various curling tournaments sanctioned and organized by Curling Canada.[475]\n",
      "Canada has enjoyed success both at the Winter Olympics and at the Summer Olympics,[476] though particularly the Winter Games as a \"winter sports nation\", and has hosted several high-profile international sporting events such as the 1976 Summer Olympics,[477] the 1988 Winter Olympics,[478] the 2010 Winter Olympics[479][480] and the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.[481] Most recently, Canada hosted the 2015 Pan American Games and 2015 Parapan American Games in Toronto, the former being one of the largest sporting events hosted by the country.[482] The country is scheduled to co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup alongside Mexico and the United States.[483]\n",
