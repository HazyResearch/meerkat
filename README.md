## Getting started
```bash
pip install mosaicml
``` 
> Note: some parts of Mosaic rely on optional dependencies. If you know which optional dependencies you'd like to install, you can do so using something like `pip install mosaicml[dev,text]` instead. See `setup.py` for a full list of optional dependencies.   
 
Load your dataset into a `DataPanel` and get going!
```python
from mosaic import DataPanel
dp = DataPanel.from_csv("...")
```


## What is Mosaic?
Mosaic makes it easier for ML practitioners to interact with high-dimensional, multi-modal data. It provides simple abstractions for data inspection, model evaluation and model training supported by efficient and robust IO under the hood.  

Mosaic's core contribution is the `DataPanel`, a simple columnar data abstraction. The Mosaic `DataPanel` can house columns of arbitrary type â€“ from integers and strings to complex, high-dimensional objects like videos, images, medical volumes and graphs. 

**`DataPanel` loads high-dimensional data lazily.**     A full high-dimensional dataset won't typically fit in memory. Behind the scenes, `DataPanel` handles this by only materializing these objects when they are needed. 
```python
from mosaic import DataPanel, ImageColumn

# Images are NOT read from disk at DataPanel creation...
dp = DataPanel({
    'text': ['The quick brown fox.', 'Jumped over.', 'The lazy dog.'],
    'image': ImageColumn(['fox.png', 'jump.png', 'dog.png']),
    'label': [0, 1, 0]
}) 

# ...only at this point is "fox.png" read from disk
dp["image"][0]
```

**`DataPanel` supports advanced indexing.**  Using indexing patterns similar to those of Pandas and NumPy, we can access a subset of a `DataPanel`'s rows and columns. 
```python
from mosaic import DataPanel, AbstractColumn
dp = ... # create DataPanel

# Pull a column out of the DataPanel
new_col: ImageColumn = dp["image"]

# Create a new DataPanel from a subset of the columns in an existing one
new_dp: DataPanel = dp[["image", "label"]] 

# Create a new DataPanel from a subset of the rows in an existing one
new_dp: DataPanel = dp[10:20] 
new_dp: DataPanel = dp[np.array([0,2,4,8])]

# Pull a column out of the DataPanel and get a subset of its rows 
new_col: ImageColumn = dp["image"][10:20]
```

**`DataPanel` supports `map`, `update` and `filter` operations.**  When training and evaluating our models, we often perform operations on each example in our dataset (*e.g.* compute a model's prediction on each example, tokenize each sentence, compute a model's embedding for each example) and store them . The `DataPanel` makes it easy to perform these operations and produce new columns (via `DataPanel.map`), store the columns alongside the original data (via `DataPanel.update`), and extract an important subset of the datset (via `DataPanel.filter`). Under the hood, dataloading is multiprocessed so that costly I/O doesn't bottleneck our computation. Consider the example below where we use update a `DataPanel` with two new columns holding model predictions and probabilities.  
```python
    # A simple evaluation loop using Mosaic 
    dp: DataPane = ... # get DataPane
    model: nn.Module = ... # get the model
    model.to(0).eval() # prepare the model for evaluation

    @torch.no_grad()
    def predict(batch: dict):
        probs = torch.softmax(model(batch["input"].to(0)), dim=-1)
        return {"probs": probs.cpu(), "pred": probs.cpu().argmax(dim=-1)}

    # updated_dp has two new `TensorColumn`s: 1 for probabilities and one
    # for predictions
    updated_dp: DataPane = dp.update(function=predict, batch_size=128, batched=True)
```

**`DataPanel` is extendable.** Mosaic makes it easy for you to make custom column types for our data. The easiest way to do this is by subclassing `AbstractCell`. Subclasses of `AbstractCell` are meant to represent one element in one column of a `DataPanel`. For example, say we want our `DataPanel` to include a column of videos we have stored on disk. We want these videos to be lazily loaded using [scikit-video](http://www.scikit-video.org/stable/index.html), so we implement a `VideoCell` class as follows: 
```python
    from mosaic import AbstractCell, CellColumn
    import skvideo.io

    class VideoCell(AbstractCell):
        
        # What information will we eventually  need to materialize the cell? 
        def __init__(filepath: str):
            super().__init__()
            self.filepath = filepath
        
        # How do we actually materialize the cell?
        def get(self):
            return skvideo.io.vread(self.filepath)
        
        # What attributes should be written to disk on `VideoCell.write`?
        @classmethod
        def _state_keys(cls) -> Collection:
            return {"filepath"}

    # We don't need to define a `VideoColumn` class and can instead just
    # create a CellColumn fro a list of `VideoCell`
    vid_column = CellColumn(map(VideoCell, ["vid1.mp4", "vid2.mp4", "vid3.mp4"]))
```
## Supported Columns
Mosaic ships with a number of core column types and the list is growing.
