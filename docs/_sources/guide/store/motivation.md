# Interactivity and Stores

As we saw earlier, stores are essential for building interactive interfaces - i.e. {ref}`reactivity <reactivity_getting_started>` and {ref}`endpoints <endpoints_getting_started>`.

```{important}
Stores are what make it possible to build reactive functions with arbitrary Python objects.
