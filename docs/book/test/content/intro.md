# Books with Jupyter and Jekyll

<img src="https://circleci.com/gh/jupyter/jupyter-book.svg?style=svg" class="left">

Jupyter Book lets you build an online book using a collection of Jupyter Notebooks
and Markdown files. Its output is similar to the excellent [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) tool,
and adds extra functionality for people running a Jupyter stack.

For an example of a book built with Jupyter Book, see the [textbook for Data 100](https://www.textbook.ds100.org/) at UC Berkeley.

Here are a few features of Jupyter Book

* All course content is written in markdown and Jupyter Notebooks, stored in `notebooks/`
* The Jupyter Book repo comes packaged with helper scripts to convert these into Jekyll pages (in `scripts/`) that can be hosted for free on GitHub
* Pages can have [Binder](https://mybinder.org) or JupyterHub links automatically added for interactivity.
* The website itself is based on Jekyll, and is highly extensible and can be freely-hosted on GitHub.
* There are lots of nifty HTML features under-the-hood, such as Turbolinks fast-navigation and
  click-to-copy in code cells.

## Getting started

To get started, you may be interested in the following links.
Here are a few links of interest:

* **[Quickstart](features/features)** is a quick demo and overview of Jupyter Book.

* **[The Jupyter Book Guide](guide/01_overview)**
  will step you through the process of configuring and building your own Jupyter Book.

* **[The Jupyter Book template repo](https://github.com/ExecutableBookProject/jupyter-book)** is the template
  repository you'll use as a start for your Jupyter Book.

* **A demo of the Jupyter Book** can be browsed via the sidebar to the left.

## Installation

Here's a brief rundown of how to create your own Jupyter Book using this site. For a more
complete guide, see [the Jupyter Book guide](guide/01_overview).

* Fork the Jupyter Book template repo
* Replace the demo notebooks in `content/` with your own notebooks and markdown files.
* Create a Table of Contents yaml file by editing `_data/toc.yaml`.
* Generate the Jekyll markdown for your notebooks by running `scripts/generate_book.py`
* Push your changes to GitHub (or wherever you host your site)!
