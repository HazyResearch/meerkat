A First Interactive GUI
=====================
To start playing around with Meerkat, create or open any directory and run,

.. code-block:: bash

    mk helloworld
    
This creates a `helloworld.py` script in your current directory. Run with

.. code-block:: bash

    mk run helloworld.py

and it should open a browser window with a simple interactive GUI.
