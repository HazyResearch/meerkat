This user guide is partitioned into two main sections: the [DataFrame](dataframe/index.md) section and the [Interactive](interactive/index.md) section. The DataFrame section covers the core data structures in Meerkat, while the Interactive section covers the interactive applications that you can build with Meerkat.

The [Cheat Sheet](cheat-sheet.md) is a quick reference for the most common operations in Meerkat.
