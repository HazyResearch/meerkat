# Running Meerkat Interfaces

Meerkat interfaces can be run as standalone applications or embedded in Jupyter notebooks.
This page describes the different ways to run Meerkat interfaces.

## Running Interfaces in Scripts

The easiest way to run Meerkat interfaces is to use the `mk` command line tool. This comes pre-installed with the Meerkat Python package, and can be used to run scripts that create Meerkat interfaces.

To run a script, use the `mk run` command:

```{bash}
mk run my_script.py
# modules are fine too: mk run module.that.contains.my_script
```

````{admonition} Tip
By default, the `mk run` command runs in development (`dev`) mode. This means that the
script is re-run every time you save a change to the script (live-reloading).

To run in production (`prod`) mode, use the `--prod` flag:

```{bash}
mk run my_script.py --prod
```

<!-- Read more about the `mk` command line tool in the :doc:`/reference/cli` reference. -->
````

**Requirements.** The only requirement is that the script create an `Page` object that is assigned to a variable. In other words, your script should look something like this:

```python
import meerkat as mk

# ....

page = mk.gui.Page(...)
```

Meerkat assumes that this variable is called `page` by default. If you use a different variable name, pass it as an argument to the `mk run` command:

```{bash}
mk run my_script.py --target <variable_name>
```

```{admonition} Note
The `mk run` command does a few things behind the scenes:

1. It creates a FastAPI server that runs the script, and serves the backend API.
2. It creates a frontend server to serve the web interface.
3. It pipes the outputs of your script, and the logs of the servers to the terminal.
```

## Interfaces in Jupyter Notebooks

Meerkat interfaces can also be run in Jupyter notebooks. This is useful if you want to view one or more interfaces in output cells, (e.g., to view a multimodal dataset or produce an interesting visualization).

To run an interface in a Jupyter notebook, Meerkat provides the `start` function in the `meerkat.gui` module. This function takes care of setting up the necessary servers.

```python
# Do this once at the top of your notebook
import meerkat as mk
mk.gui.start()
```

Then, whenever you want to run an interface, simply create an `Interface` object in a code cell, and it will be displayed in the output cell.

```python
interface = mk.gui.Interface(...)
```

````{admonition} Tip
Meerkat DataFrames come built in with a `gui` namespace that contains a collection of
useful interfaces for notebooks. For example, to view a DataFrame in a notebook as a
table, simply call the `table` method:

```python
df.gui.table()
```

To view it as a gallery, call the `gallery` method:

```python
df.gui.gallery()
```

<!-- To see the full list of interfaces, see the :doc:`/reference/dataframe` reference. -->
````

```{admonition} Warning
Interactions with interfaces in output cells affect the state of the notebook. This is good to keep in mind when running interfaces for labeling or otherwise modifying data.
```

## The `start` Function for Scripting

The `start` function can also be used to run Meerkat interfaces in scripts. While we recommend using the `mk run` command in most cases, there are a few situations where you might want to use `start` instead:

1. You want to set breakpoints in your script for debugging. `mk run` does not support this.
2. You want to have access to a Python interpreter while the script is running. By default, `start`
   will block the current thread, and keep a Python interpreter running so you can interact with
   the script.

To use this method, call the `start` function in your script before creating an interface.

```python
import meerkat as mk

# ....

mk.gui.start()
interface = mk.gui.Interface(...)
```

To run the script, use the `python` command directly (not `mk run`)

```{bash}
python my_script.py
```

```{admonition} Attention
Using `start` does not support live-reloading. If you want to use live-reloading, use the `mk run` command instead.
```
